# Introduction to Microcontrollers
Embedded systems are computer hardware and computer software designed for a specific function
ES are tightly contrained on their cost, size, resources, and power. They are compact, portable and suitable for mass production

- Microprocessor: General purpose processing units - variety of complex tasks 
- Microcontrollers: Contains CPU, memmory, I/O - specific tasks with low power
- ASIC: Application-Specific Integrated Circuit - High performance
- FPGA: Field Programmable Gate Array
- GPU: Graphics Processing Unit
