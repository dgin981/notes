# Capacitors and Inductors
Capacitor: $i_C = C \frac{dv_C}{dt}$
Inductor: $v_L = L \frac{di_L}{dt}$
currents and voltage is opposing

capacitor is open cct. with DC, $i_C = 0$
inductor is short cct. with DC, $v_L = 0$

$v_C$ cannot change instantly
$i_L$ cannot change instantly

$v_C(0^-) = v_C(0^+)$
$i_L(0^-) = i_L(0^+)$

$$\frac{dv_C}{dt}(0^+) = \frac{1}{C}i_C(0^+)$$
$$\frac{di_L}{dt}(0^+) = \frac{1}{L}v_L(0^+)$$
