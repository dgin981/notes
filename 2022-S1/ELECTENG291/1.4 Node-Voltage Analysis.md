# Nodal Voltage Analysis
A super node is two essential nodes connected by a voltage source
So, the essential node voltages can be related by the voltage source
Combining NVA equations for each essential node and then adding an 
equation for the voltage relation

You can avoid a supernode by putting one of the essential nodes in a supernode
to be ground.
