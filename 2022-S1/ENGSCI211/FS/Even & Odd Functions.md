# Even & Odd Functions
- Even function has symmetry about the y-axis $f(-x)=f(x)$
- Odd function has rotational symmetry about the origin $f(-x)=-f(x)$
- Functions that do not satisfy either conditions are neither even or odd

if $x^n$, $n$ shows whether the function is even or odd
$\cos(x)$ is an even function
$\sin(x)$ is an odd function

#### Half Range Integration
$$ \int^a_{-a} f_{\text{even}}(x) \space dx = 2 \int^a_0 f_{\text{even}}(x) \space dx$$

$$ \int^a_{-a} f_{\text{odd}(x) \space dx = 0} $$
