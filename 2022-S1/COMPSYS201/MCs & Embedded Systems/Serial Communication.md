#### Types

Simplex
- Unidirectional

Half-Duplex
- Bidirectional non-simulataneously
- one device sending data at a time

Full-Duplex
- Bidirectional and simultaneous

#### ATmega328P Serial Interfaces

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
- Full duplex synchronous data transfer

Universal Synchronous Asynchronous Receiver and Transmitter (USART)
- Full duplex synchronous and asynchronous data transfer

Two Wire Serial Interface (TWI)
- Half duplex synchronous data transfer

#### SPI

MOSI (master out - slave in)
MISO (master in slave out)
SCK: clock generated by master

#### USART

Clock could be generated by either Master or Slave
TxD: transmit data
RxD: receive data
XCK: clock

transfer up to 8 bits at a time + parity bit

#### TWI

SCL: clock
